Where is the API docs?
=====

API docs is generated from source code comments, and can be read online at [MaixPy API on Sipeed Wiki](https://wiki.sipeed.com/maixpy/api/index.html).

If you want to preview API doc offline, there are two ways:
1. Download offline docs file(`maixpy_vx.x.x_doc.zip`) from [MaixPy releases page](https://github.com/sipeed/MaixPy/releases).
2. Build MaixPy project, and API doc will be generated in `MaixPy/docs/api/` directory.
