## Prerequisite Knowledge

Please first learn to use the [pinmap](./pinmap.md) module to set pin functions.

To use a pin for `UART` functionality, you must first set its function to `UART` using `pinmap`.

## Serial Port Overview

A serial port is a communication method that includes both hardware and communication protocol definitions.

* Hardware includes:

  * 3 pins: `GND`, `RX`, and `TX`. Communication between two devices is **cross-connected** for `RX` and `TX`, meaning one device’s `TX` connects to the other’s `RX`, and both `GND` pins are connected together.
  * A controller, usually inside the chip, also called a `UART` peripheral. A chip usually has one or more `UART` controllers, each with corresponding pins.
* Serial communication protocol: To ensure proper communication, a protocol defines timing, baud rate, parity bits, etc. The baud rate is the most commonly used parameter.

Through the board’s serial port, you can communicate with other microcontrollers or SoCs. For example, MaixCAM can perform human detection and send the detected coordinates to an STM32/Arduino via the serial port.

## Choosing the Appropriate I2C to Use

First, we need to know which pins and I2C interfaces are available on the device, as shown below:

| Device Model | Pin Diagram                                                                        | Pin Multiplexing Description                                                                              |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| MaixCAM      | ![](https://wiki.sipeed.com/hardware/zh/lichee/assets/RV_Nano/intro/RV_Nano_3.jpg) | The board’s silkscreen shows the pin name (e.g., `A19`) and function name (e.g., `UART1_TX`).             |
| MaixCAM-Pro  | ![maixcam\_pro\_io](/static/image/maixcam_pro_io.png)                              | The first label (e.g., `A19`) is the pin name, corresponding to the function name (e.g., `UART1_TX`).     |
| MaixCAM2     | ![maixcam2\_io](/static/image/maixcam2_io.png)                                     | The first label (e.g., `IO0_A21`) is the pin name, corresponding to the function name (e.g., `UART4_TX`). |

Note: Pins may be used for other purposes by default. It’s best to avoid these pins—see the [pinmap](./pinmap.md) documentation.

### Notes for MaixCAM/MaixCAM-Pro Serial Port Usage:

* By default, a `UART0` serial port is routed from the USB port. You can use the matching Type-C adapter board to directly access the serial pins, or you can use the onboard `A16 (TX)` and `A17 (RX)` pins, which are equivalent to the USB-exposed serial pins.
* When using the USB-exposed serial port on MaixCAM, note that the Type-C plug’s orientation affects the adapter board’s `RX` and `TX` pins (swapped if reversed; silkscreen matches when the **Type-C female port faces forward**). If communication fails, try flipping the Type-C connector.
* **`UART0` on MaixCAM prints boot logs** during startup and prints `serial ready` when boot completes. If communicating with a microcontroller, ignore this initial output. Boot logs can also help diagnose startup issues.
* The `TX` pin of `UART0` is also a boot mode detection pin. It **must not be pulled low during power-on**, or the device won’t boot. If using a 3.3 V to 5 V level shifter, ensure it doesn’t pull `TX` low by default (use a level-shifting chip or keep it floating). If the board won’t start, check if `TX` is being pulled low.
* If `UART0` causes issues, consider using another UART such as `UART1`.
* `UART0` is also the system’s default `maix protocol` port.

### Notes for MaixCAM2:

* `MaixCAM2` has multiple serial ports: `UART0 / UART1 / UART2 / UART3 / UART4`—don’t mix them up.
* `UART0` is the system terminal and log port.

### Baud Rate Limitations

Not all baud rates are supported. Unless necessary, use `115200` (universally supported). Other baud rates may have high error rates or be unsupported.

Common tested baud rates (contributions welcome):

* `MaixCAM / MaixCAM-Pro`: `115200`.
* `MaixCAM2`: `115200`. Theoretical max: `4000000 bits/s`. Formula:
  `baud = uart_clk / (fractional_div * 16)`
  Default `uart_clk`: `200000000`. Integer part: `uart_clk / (baud * 16)`. Fractional part: `round((uart_clk % (baud * 16)) * 16 / (baud * 16)) / 16`.
  Example: For `115200`, divisor = `108.5`, precision = `0.0064%`.

## Serial Port Hardware Wiring

For two devices to communicate, connect three pins: `GND`, `RX`, `TX`. Connect `TX` of one to `RX` of the other, and connect both `GND`s together.

## Using Serial Port in MaixPy

Once the two boards are connected (crossed `RX`/`TX`, common `GND`), you can use the software.

Basic MaixPy code:

```python
from maix import uart

serial_dev = uart.UART("/dev/ttyS0", 115200)
serial_dev.write_str("Hello MaixPy")
```

`/dev/ttyS0` is the serial device. Use `print(uart.list_devices())` to list all devices.

For pins that are already mapped to UART, you can use them directly. For others, set their function via `pinmap` before creating the `UART` object:

```python
from maix import uart, pinmap, time, sys, err

# ports = uart.list_devices() # list all UARTs

device_id = sys.device_id()
if device_id == "maixcam2":
    pin_function = {
        "IO0_A21": "UART4_TX",
        "IO0_A22": "UART4_RX"
    }
    device = "/dev/ttyS4"
else:
    pin_function = {
        "A16": "UART0_TX",
        "A17": "UART0_RX"
    }
    device = "/dev/ttyS0"

for pin, func in pin_function.items():
    err.check_raise(pinmap.set_pin_function(pin, func), f"Failed set pin{pin} function to {func}")

serial_dev = uart.UART(device, 115200)
serial_dev.write_str("Hello MaixPy")
```

## Connecting Serial Port to a Computer

* **Why doesn’t a serial device appear on my computer when I plug in USB?**
  The board’s USB port is for USB functions (e.g., USB network adapter), not USB-to-UART. For terminal access, use SSH.

* **How to communicate between the computer and board via UART?**
  Use a USB-to-UART adapter (e.g., [this one](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?spm=a1z10.5-c-s.w4002-24984936573.13.73cc59d6AkB9bS&id=610365562537)). Connect USB to the PC and UART to the board.

* **How to view boot logs or interact with the board via UART terminal?**
  SSH is recommended for terminal interaction. For serial terminal access:

  * **MaixCAM/MaixCAM-Pro**: Connect USB-to-UART adapter to `UART0` (`A16` TX, `A17` RX). In `/boot/uEnv.txt`, comment or remove the `consoledev` line to enable UART0 terminal, then reboot. You’ll see boot logs and have terminal access.
  * **MaixCAM2**: Connect USB-to-UART adapter to `UART0` (`U0T`/`U0R`). You’ll see boot logs and have terminal access after boot.


## Sending Data

There are mainly two functions for sending data: `write_str` and `write`.

The `write_str` function is used to send strings, while `write` is used to send byte streams, i.e., `str` and `bytes` types, which can be converted to each other. For example:
* `"A"` can be converted to `b"A"` using the `encode()` method, and vice versa, `b"A"` can be converted back to `"A"` using the `decode()` method.
* `str` cannot display some invisible characters, such as the ASCII value `0`, which is generally `\0` in strings and serves as a terminator. In `bytes` type, it can be stored as `b"\x00"`.
* This is more useful for non-ASCII encoded strings. For example, the Chinese character `好` in `UTF-8` encoding is represented by three bytes `\xe5\xa5\xbd`. We can use `"好".encode("utf-8")` to get `b"\xe5\xa5\xbd"`, and `b'\xe5\xa5\xbd'.decode("utf-8)` to get `"好"`.

So if we need to send byte data, we can use the `write()` method to send it. For example:

```python
bytes_content = b'\x01\x02\x03'
serial.write(bytes_content)
```

Therefore, for the `str` type, you can use `serial.write(str_content.encode())` instead of `write_str` to send it.

If you have other data types that you want to convert into a **string to send**, you can use `Python string formatting` to create a string. For example, to send `I have xxx apple`, where `xxx` is an integer variable, you can do:

```python
num = 10
content = "I have {} apple".format(num)
content2 = f"I have {num} apple"
content3 = "I have {:04d} apple".format(num)
content4 = f"I have {num:d} apple"
print(content)
print(content2)
print(content3)
print(content4)
print(type(content))
serial.write_str(content)
```

Additionally, you can encode the data into a **binary stream to send**. For example, the first 4 bytes are hexadecimal `AABBCCDD`, followed by an `int` type value, and finally a `0xFF` at the end. You can use `struct.pack` to encode it (if this is unclear, you can read the explanation later):

```python
from struct import pack
num = 10
bytes_content = b'\xAA\xBB\xCC\xDD'
bytes_content += pack("<i", num)
bytes_content += b'\xFF'
print(bytes_content, type(bytes_content))
serial.write(bytes_content)
```

Here, `pack("<i", num)` encodes `num` as an `int` type, which is a 4-byte signed integer. The `<` symbol indicates little-endian encoding, with the low byte first. Here, `num = 10`, the 4-byte hexadecimal representation is `0x0000000A`, and little-endian encoding puts the low byte `0x0A` first, resulting in `b'\x0A\x00\x00\x00'`.

> Here, we use `i` to encode `int` type data as an example. Other types, such as `B` for `unsigned char`, etc., can also be used. More `struct.pack` formatting options can be searched online with `python struct pack`.

In this way, the final data sent is `AA BB CC DD 0A 00 00 00 FF` as binary data.

## Receiving Data

Use the `read` method to read data directly:

```python
while not app.need_exit():
    data = serial.read()
    if data:
        print(data)
    time.sleep_ms(1)
```

Similarly, the data obtained by the `read` method is also of the `bytes` type. Here, `read` reads a batch of data sent by the other party. If there is no data, it returns `b''`, which is an empty byte.

Here, `time.sleep_ms(1)` is used to sleep for `1ms`, which frees up the CPU so that this thread does not occupy all CPU resources. `1ms` does not affect the program's efficiency, especially in multithreading.

In addition, the `read` function has two parameters:
* `len`: Represents the maximum length you want to receive. The default is `-1`, meaning it will return as much as there is in the buffer. If you pass a value `>0`, it means it will return data up to that length.
* `timeout`:
  * The default `0` means it will return immediately with whatever data is in the buffer. If `len` is `-1`, it returns all data; if a length is specified, it returns data not exceeding that length.
  * `<0` means it waits until data is received before returning. If `

len` is `-1`, it waits until data is received and returns (blocking read for all data); if a length is specified, it waits until it reaches `len` before returning.
  * `>0` means it will return after this time, regardless of whether data is received.

It may seem complex, but here are some common parameter combinations:
* `read()`: Which is `read(-1, 0)`, reads the data received in the buffer, usually a batch of data sent by the other party. It returns immediately when the other party has stopped sending (within one character's sending time).
* `read(len = -1, timeout = -1)`: Blocking read for a batch of data, waits for the other party to send data and returns only when there is no more data within one character's sending time.
* `read(len = 10, timeout = 1000)`: Blocking read for 10 characters, returns when 10 characters are read or 1000ms has passed without receiving any data.

## Setting a Callback Function for Receiving Data

In MCU development, a serial port interrupt event usually occurs when data is received. MaixPy has already handled the interrupt at the bottom layer, so developers don't need to handle the interrupt themselves. If you want to call a callback function upon receiving data, you can use `set_received_callback` to set the callback function:

```python

from maix import uart, app, time

def on_received(serial : uart.UART, data : bytes):
    print("received:", data)
    # send back
    serial.write(data)

device = "/dev/ttyS0"

serial = uart.UART(device, 115200)
serial.set_received_callback(on_received)

serial0.write_str("hello\r\n")
print("sent hello")
print("wait data")

while not app.need_exit():
    time.sleep_ms(100) # sleep to make CPU free
```

When data is received, the set callback function will be called in **another thread**. Since it's called in another thread, unlike an interrupt function, you don't have to exit the function quickly. You can handle some tasks in the callback function before exiting, but be aware of common multithreading issues.

If you use the callback function method to receive data, do not use the `read` function to read it, or it will read incorrectly.

## Using Other Serial Ports

Each pin may correspond to different peripheral functions, which is also known as pin multiplexing. As shown below, each pin corresponds to different functions. For example, pin `A17` (silkscreen identification on the board) corresponds to `GPIOA17`, `UART0_RX`, and `PWM5` functions. The default function is `UART0_RX`.

![](https://wiki.sipeed.com/hardware/zh/lichee/assets/RV_Nano/intro/RV_Nano_3.jpg)
![maixcam_pro_io](/static/image/maixcam_pro_io.png)

By default, you can directly use `UART0` as shown above. For other serial port pins, they are not set to the serial peripheral function by default, so you need to set the mapping to use other serial ports. Use `pinmap.set_pin_function` to set it.

Let's take `UART1` as an example. First, set the pin mapping to choose the serial port function, then use the device number `/dev/ttyS1`. Note that `uart.list_devices()` will not return manually mapped serial ports by default, so you can directly pass the parameters manually:

```python
from maix import app, uart, pinmap, time

pinmap.set_pin_function("A18", "UART1_RX")
pinmap.set_pin_function("A19", "UART1_TX")

device = "/dev/ttyS1"

serial1 = uart.UART(device, 115200)
```

## Application Layer Communication Protocol

### Concept and Character Protocol

Serial ports only define the hardware communication timing. To let the receiver understand the meaning of the character stream sent by the sender, an application communication protocol is usually established. For example, if the sender needs to send coordinates containing two integer values `x, y`, the following protocol is established:

* **Frame Header**: When I start sending the `$` symbol, it means I'm about to start sending valid data.
> **Content**: Designing a start symbol is because serial communication is stream-based. For example, sending `12345` twice may result in receiving `12345123` at some moment. The `45` from the second frame has not been received. We can determine a complete data frame based on start and end symbols.
* The value range of `x, y` is 0~65535, i.e., an unsigned short integer (`unsigned short`). I'll first send `x` then `y`, separated by a comma, such as `10,20`.
* **Frame Tail**: Finally, I'll send a `*` to indicate that I've finished sending this data.

In this way, sending a data packet looks like `$10,20*` as a string. The other party can receive and parse it using C language:

```c
// 1. Receive data
// 2. Determine if the reception is complete based on the frame header and tail, and store the complete frame data in the buff array
// 3. Parse a frame of data
uint16_t x, y;
sscanf(buff, "$%d,%d*", &x, &y);
```

Thus, we have defined a simple character communication protocol with a certain degree of reliability. However, since we usually use parameters like `115200 8 N 1` for serial ports, where `N` means no parity check, we can add a **checksum** to our protocol at the end. For example:

* Here, we add a checksum value after `x, y`, ranging from 0 to 255. It is the sum of all previous characters modulo 255.
* Taking `$10,20` as an example, in `Python`, you can simply use the `sum` function: `sum(b'$10,20') % 255 --> 20`, and send `$10,20,20*`.
* The receiver reads the checksum `20`, calculates it in the same way as `$10,20`, and if it is also `20`, it means no transmission error occurred. Otherwise, we assume a transmission error and discard the packet to wait for the next one.

In MaixPy, encoding a character protocol can be done using Python's string formatting feature:

```python
x = 10
y = 20
content = "${},{}*".format(x, y)
print(content)
```

### Binary Communication Protocol

The character protocol above has a clear characteristic of using visible characters to transmit data. The advantage is simplicity and human readability. However, it uses an inconsistent number of characters and larger data volumes. For example, `$10,20*` and `$1000,2000*` have varying lengths, with `1000` using 4 characters, which means 4 bytes. We know an unsigned short integer (`uint16`) can represent values ranging from `0~65535` using only two bytes. This reduces the transmission data. 

We also know visible characters can be converted to binary via ASCII tables, such as `$1000` being `0x24 0x31 0x30 0x30 0x30` in binary, requiring 5 bytes. If we directly encode `1000` in binary as `0x03E8`, we can send `0x24 0x03 0xE8` in just 3 bytes, reducing communication overhead.

Additionally, `0x03E8` is a 2-byte representation with `0xE8` as the low byte, transmitted first in little-endian encoding. The opposite is big-endian encoding. Both are fine as long as both parties agree on one.

In MaixPy, converting a number to bytes is simple with `struct.pack`. For example, `0x03E8` (decimal `1000`):

```python
from struct import pack
b = pack("<H", 1000)
print(b)
```

Here, `<H` indicates little-endian encoding, with `H` denoting a `uint16` data type, resulting in `b'\xe8\x03'` as bytes.

Similarly, binary protocols can have a frame header, data content, checksum, frame tail, or a frame length field instead of a frame tail, based on preference.

### Built-in MaixPy Communication Protocol

MaixPy also includes a built-in communication protocol.

Using this protocol, it is possible to implement application switching, application control, and data retrieval via serial communication or even TCP.

For example, the coordinates detected by an AI detection application after identifying an object can be parsed using this protocol.
