## What is a Pin

A pin is a physical hardware pin exposed from the chip/development board. They are visible and tangible around the chip package. In English, we refer to them as `Pin`.

## What is an On-chip Peripheral

These are components built into the chip, other than the CPU cores. The “external” here is relative to the `CPU core` (internal), as opposed to “off-chip modules” which are external to the entire chip.
For example, the following is the internal architecture diagram of the `MaixCAM/MaixCAM-Pro` chip:

We can see that the core consists of two RISC-V cores and one 8051 core. In addition, there are many peripherals such as `GPIO`, `UART`, and `H.264 codec`, all of which are considered on-chip peripherals.
Importantly, **peripherals here do not necessarily require pins to be brought out of the chip** — for example, the `H.264 codec` is also a peripheral but does not need external pins for interaction.

Also note that here `GPIO` is a peripheral function within the chip and is not the same as the physical pins (`Pin`) exposed from the chip.

## What is Pin Multiplexing / Pin Mapping

For peripherals that require interaction with the outside world, such as `GPIO` or `I2C`,

* `GPIO` can control pin input/output,
* `I2C` can communicate with other chips via two pins (`SDA/SCL`).

The simplest design is one pin for each function: for example, in the architecture diagram above, `GPIO` has 54 pins, and `I2C` has 5 sets, requiring a total of `54 + 2 × 5 = 64` pins.

The more functions that require pins, the more pins need to be exposed from the chip, which increases chip size. In reality, it’s rare to need all 54 `GPIO`s and all 5 `I2C`s simultaneously.
We can add a pin multiplexing circuit between peripherals and pins, so a single pin can switch between `GPIO` and `I2C`. This way, fewer pins can support more functions.
For example, with 50 pins, 10 of them could be configured either as `GPIO` or as `I2C`. This is pin multiplexing, usually called `pinmux` in English.

Due to hardware design limits, most chips allow a pin to be mapped to only a few fixed functions. For example, the `MaixCAM-Pro` pin mapping is shown below:

![maixcam\_pro\_io](/static/image/maixcam_pro_io.png)

Take the `A17` pin on the right: it supports three functions — `GPIOA17 / UART0_RX / PWM5`. We can select which function to use.
If the default is `UART0_RX` but we need `PWM5`, we configure the pinmux accordingly.

In MaixPy, the `maix.peripheral.pinmap` module (or simply `maix.pinmap`) is used to query and set pin multiplexing (pin function mapping).

> Other benefits of pin multiplexing:
>
> * **Save pin count**: SoCs integrate many modules (CPU, GPU, memory controllers, I/O interfaces, communication modules, etc.). Assigning separate pins to each function would require huge pin counts, increasing packaging complexity and cost. Pinmux allows one pin to serve multiple purposes, reducing pin numbers significantly.
> * **Reduce packaging & manufacturing cost**: Fewer pins allow for smaller chip packages, lowering material and manufacturing costs. Smaller packages also save PCB space, enabling more compact designs.
> * **Increase design flexibility**: Pinmux provides flexibility for different application scenarios by enabling different pin functions via software configuration.
> * **Simplify PCB layout**: Fewer pins make PCB routing easier, reducing layers and vias, which lowers production difficulty and cost.
> * **Optimize performance**: Choosing optimal pin functions can shorten signal paths and reduce noise/interference, improving overall system reliability.

## Using Pinmap in MaixPy

### Pin Function Diagrams

Different boards expose different pins. Below are pin mapping diagrams for each device. For detailed mappings, refer to the schematic or the chip manual’s Pinmux section:

### Mapping Pin Functions in MaixPy

In MaixPy, use `maix.pinmap.set_pin_function` to set a pin function.

Example — set `A17` pin on `MaixCAM/MaixCAM-Pro`:

```python
from maix import pinmap

pinmap.set_pin_function("A17", "GPIOA17")
```

Here `A17` is the pin name, and `GPIOA17` is the on-chip peripheral function.
This changes the default `UART0_RX` to `GPIO`. Now, even if data is sent to `UART0`, the chip won’t receive it because the pin is in `GPIO` mode.

After setting to `GPIO`, follow the [GPIO usage](./gpio.md) docs to output high/low levels or read input.

### Get All Functions of a Pin

```python
from maix import pinmap

funcs = pinmap.get_pin_functions("A17")
print(funcs)
```

Print all pins and their functions:

```python
from maix.peripheral import pinmap

print("All pins of MaixCAM:")
print(pinmap.get_pins())

print("All pin's functions:")
for pin in pinmap.get_pins():
    funcs = pinmap.get_pin_functions(pin)
    print(f"{pin:10s}: {', '.join(funcs)}")
```

### Query Current Function of a Pin

Note: support varies by board type:

* **MaixCAM / MaixCAM-Pro**: Mapping info is stored in an array, not read directly from hardware, so you must set it first for accuracy ([source code here](https://github.com/sipeed/MaixCDK/blob/main/components/peripheral/port/maixcam/maix_pinmap.cpp)).
* **MaixCAM2**: Reads directly from hardware, so results are accurate.

```python
from maix import pinmap

func = pinmap.get_pin_function("A17")
print(func)
```
