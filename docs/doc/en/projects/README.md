title: Introduction and Summary of MaixCAM MaixPy Project Practices
---

## Introduction

This section provides:

* Several common project practice examples for community members to reference and replicate, as well as to inspire more and better applications and projects.
* Some open-source projects from community members for learning and reference.

Besides this document, there are several other ways to find MaixPy-based projects:

### MaixPy Official Documentation

You can find practical projects in the menu on the left side of this documentation, such as `Line Following Car`.

If you have a good project or a recommended one, you're very welcome to click the "Edit this page" button in the top right corner and submit a PR (Pull Request) to add it to the documentation.

### MaixHub Project Sharing Plaza

You can find shared projects in the [MaixHub Project Sharing](https://maixhub.com/share?type=project) section.

High-quality projects may also be linked in the MaixPy official documentation.

You’re encouraged to share your project tutorials there—this earns you official (guaranteed) and community member cash rewards (especially for high-quality, urgently needed solutions).

### MaixHub App Sharing

Besides project sharing, you can also find runnable applications in the [MaixHub App Store](https://maixhub.com/app). Some of them may be written with MaixPy, and if the author provides source code or detailed tutorials, they’re worth learning from.

### GitHub Search

Searching for `MaixPy` or `MaixCAM` on [GitHub](https://github.com) can also lead you to many high-quality open-source projects.


## Open Source Project Summary

These are usually complete projects that include source code, documentation, demo videos, and more.

### Tools

* [MaixPy-UI-Lib](https://github.com/aristorechina/MaixPy-UI-Lib): A lightweight UI library developed with MaixPy, written in pure Python. It supports a variety of widgets, is easy to use and extend, and includes many example codes such as LAB/HSV offline threshold tuning tools.
* [Offline Threshold Tuning Tool Based on MaixPy](https://maixhub.com/share/103): A class-based offline threshold tuning tool with no third-party dependencies—ready to use directly.
* [Using Serial Screen for Offline Threshold Adjustment on Maixcam](https://maixhub.com/share/104): Connects to an external serial screen to enable offline threshold adjustment, suitable for applications requiring an external display.
* [CAM Offline Manual Threshold Editor](https://maixhub.com/share/102): Another manual offline threshold editor with simple and easy-to-understand code, great for learning and reference.

### Competition

* [MaixCam-Tic-Tac-Toe – 2024 National College Student Electronic Design Competition (Problem E - Tic-Tac-Toe Game Device)](https://github.com/HYK-X/MaixCam_Tic_Tac_Toe_2024): A tic-tac-toe robot project based on the Sipeed Maix series development board, using computer vision techniques. This is a complete solution for the 2024 National College Student Electronic Design Competition (Problem E - Tic-Tac-Toe Game Device).
